I want a system that would allow me to enter issues reported by my clients.

1.   *    Every issue must be given a unique code or ID

2.   *    The app should allow me to describe the issue
 
3.   *    Add a severity tag [low, mild, severe, chaotic] to the issue

4.   *    Type in the name of any of my workers I want to assign the issue

5.   *    The issue must be saved with the current date and time

6.   *    When I click save, a pop up should tell me that my issue has been saved and would be looked at shortly

7.   *    The issues must be saved and stored in the browser with all the details above

8.       I want to be able to see all issues that has come in in a table

9.       And they should be ordered according to the severity; chaotic first, low last

10.    	 I love my app with beautiful designs that would enhance user experience and not just for beauty sake
